World War II had an extreme impact on lives around the world, and while American soil may not have seen battle, the homefront certainly felt the effects of the conflict. One of the most well known societal effects of the War on the USA was the shifting roles of women during the time. This essay section will serve to analyze the realities of women during World War II in both the working and domestic spheres, as well as interrogate the extent to which gender roles and stereotypes were challenged and enforced during this time.

Anticipation of American involvement in World War II resulted in the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, and when America joined the war in 1940 all eligible men from ages 18 to 45 were included in the draft.[^1] This resulted in a dearth of available, capable workers that needed to be filled in order to meet war production quotas. Without the normally available pool of male workers, the government turned to those still on the homefront which were, namely, women. You can see these recruitment efforts in many of the pieces of propaganda of the time, which appealed to a personal sense of national pride to encourage women to join the workforce, as well as raise moral for the women already in it. Women found new jobs in factories, hospitals, and other places of work, with 6 million women estimated to have joined the work force during WWII.[^2] However, it is important to also consider what jobs were available to who. Many women at the time who were in lower income households were already holding jobs to make ends meet, and women of color were more likely to get jobs with harsher working conditions and to be mistreated.[^3] While the influx of women into the workplace is undeniably a positive for women moving forwards, the experience was not a universally welcoming one.

However, despite the movement past gender roles in the workforce, women were also expected to maintain traditional gender roles in the domestic sphere. While the government encouraged work in factories and other war aiding areas, little to no help was offered when it came to familial responsibilities. Just as it was before the war, women were expected to manage their households by cooking, cleaning, and looking after their kids. Childcare during work hours fell to the working women to sort out, and gender performance in the domestic sphere was still expected to be done as perfectly as possible. Additionally, just as the government called for aid in the workforce, it also asked for aid in the domestic sphere. Rationing was common during the war, with necessary resources such as meat, sugar, and oil being severely limited. Women had to find ways to make ends meet with both time and available resources being severely limited by the war effort. Knitting bees and victory gardens[^4] were also common practice to aid in homefront war efforts, with local communities trying to foot the labor needed to get clothes to soldiers and diminish the amount of metal going into food cans. An excellent example of women’s continued expectations and responsibilities in the domestic sphere is the shift in the magazine Good Housekeeping. Good Housekeeping[^5] had been established since the 1850’s and was a resource for housewives who were tasked with taking care of their households. The magazine upheld this status quo during the war, showing women how to deal with rationing and shortages and treating the war effort and the status quo shake up more as a problem to solve rather than a true shift of societal values.
	
While this time is lauded as an advance for women past traditional gender roles and into equality in the workplace, the reality of the time is not as cut and dry. Women were still expected to maintain their appearances for men, despite their now occupying traditional male jobs, where this focus on looks was not the expectation for their male counter parts. Their looks were explicitly tied to war moral by society, and they were expected to be “girls worth fighting for”, being seen more as objects of morale rather than people who were doing their best to aid in the war effort. Harassment and work place wage discrimination were issues many women faced as well. Even recruitment had a gendered slant to it, with many recruitment posters downplaying the difficulty of the work women were doing and drawing comparisons to stereotypical gendered domestic tasks to try and appeal to the female demographic. After the war, women’s workplace efforts were dismissed as women were encouraged to leave the workforce and return to their “proper” places. There was an emphasis on the idea that women in the workforce was now silly and improper, and that men needed to take their place or the status quo would break entirely. This return to status quo did not completely remove women from more male dominated fields, but choosing to stay was going against explicit governmental and societal urgings. Despite all of this, women gained a foothold, however precarious, that was able to be used to lobby for equal pay and equal job opportunities in the future. This can still be seen today, with recruitment propaganda from the time being used in many women’s rights movements, with Rosie the Riveter being one of the most popular examples. While it may not be the complete step forwards in the feminist movement it is often portrayed as, it is an important point in history that we still look back on today.[^6]

To summarize and conclude, women during World War II were expected to operate in both the working and domestic spheres, creating a tension between traditional gender roles with their corresponding expectations and the explicit breaking of those gender roles. While the time was not the idyllic liberation of women it is often represented as, it does serve as an important moment in the history of women’s rights and is used to rally around even today.
