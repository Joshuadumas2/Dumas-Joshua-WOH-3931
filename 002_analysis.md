World War II had an extreme impact on lives around the world, and while American soil may not have seen battle, the homefront certainly felt the effects of the conflict. One of the most well-known societal effects of the War on the USA was the shifting roles of women during the time. This essay section will serve to analyze the realities of women during World War II in both the working and domestic spheres, as well as interrogate the extent to which gender roles and stereotypes were challenged and enforced during this time.

Anticipation of American involvement in World War II resulted in the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, and when America joined the war in 1940 all eligible men from ages 18 to 45 were included in the draft.[^1] This resulted in a dearth of available, capable workers that needed to be filled to meet war production quotas. Without the normally available pool of male workers, the government turned to those still on the homefront which were, namely, women. You can see these recruitment efforts in many of the pieces of propaganda of the time, which appealed to a personal sense of national pride to encourage women to join the workforce, as well as raise morale for the women already in it. Women found new jobs in factories, hospitals, and other places of work, with 6 million women estimated to have joined the workforce during WWII.[^2] However, it is important to also consider what jobs were available to who. Many women at the time who were in lower-income households were already holding jobs to make ends meet, and women of color were more likely to get jobs with harsher working conditions and to be mistreated.[^3] While the influx of women into the workplace is undeniably a positive for women moving forward, the experience was not a universally welcoming one.

However, despite the movement past gender roles in the workforce, women were also expected to maintain traditional gender roles in the domestic sphere. While the government encouraged work in factories and other war-aiding areas, little to no help was offered when it came to familial responsibilities. Just as it was before the war, women were expected to manage their households by cooking, cleaning, and looking after their kids. Childcare during work hours fell to the working women to sort out, and gender performance in the domestic sphere was still expected to be done as perfectly as possible. Additionally, just as the government called for aid in the workforce, it also asked for aid in the domestic sphere. Rationing was common during the war, with necessary resources such as meat, sugar, and oil being severely limited. Women had to find ways to make ends meet with both time and available resources being severely limited by the war effort. Knitting bees and victory gardens[^4] were also common practices to aid in homefront war efforts, with local communities trying to foot the labor needed to get clothes to soldiers and diminish the amount of metal going into food cans. An excellent example of women’s continued expectations and responsibilities in the domestic sphere is the shift in the magazine Good Housekeeping.[^5] Good Housekeeping had been established since the 1850s and was a resource for housewives who were tasked with taking care of their households. The magazine upheld this status quo during the war, showing women how to deal with rationing and shortages and treating the war effort and the status quo shake-up more as a problem to solve rather than a true shift of societal values.
	
While this time is lauded as an advance for women past traditional gender roles and into equality in the workplace, the reality of the time is not as cut and dry. Women were still expected to maintain their appearances for men, despite their now occupying traditional male jobs, where this focus on looks was not the expectation for their male counterparts. Their looks were explicitly tied to war morale by society, and they were expected to be “girls worth fighting for”, being seen more as objects of morale rather than people who were doing their best to aid in the war effort. Harassment and work place wage discrimination were issues many women faced as well. Even recruitment had a gendered slant to it, with many recruitment posters downplaying the difficulty of the work women were doing and drawing comparisons to stereotypical gendered domestic tasks to try and appeal to the female demographic. After the war, women’s workplace efforts were dismissed as women were encouraged to leave the workforce and return to their “proper” places. There was an emphasis on the idea that women in the workforce was now silly and improper, and that men needed to take their place or the status quo would break entirely. This return to the status quo did not completely remove women from more male-dominated fields, but choosing to stay was going against explicit governmental and societal urgings. Despite all of this, women gained a foothold, however precarious, that was able to be used to lobby for equal pay and equal job opportunities in the future. This can still be seen today, with recruitment propaganda from the time being used in many women’s rights movements, with Rosie the Riveter being one of the most popular examples. While it may not be the complete step forward in the feminist movement it is often portrayed as, it is an important point in history that we still look back on today.[^6]

To summarize and conclude, women during World War II were expected to operate in both the working and domestic spheres, creating a tension between traditional gender roles with their corresponding expectations and the explicit breaking of those gender roles. While the time was not the idyllic liberation of women it is often represented as it does serve as an important moment in the history of women’s rights and is used to rally around even today.






## ANALYSIS 2: Homefront Economics - Katya Palma

During the Second World War, the economy of the United States went through significant changes. The government implemented many price controls and rationing policies, such as limiting the use of materials like gasoline, metal, and rubber. Production shifted almost entirely from consumer goods to military goods for obvious reasons, and unemployment was at a historical low as factory jobs multiplied to support wartime production. War bonds were also incredibly popular and heavily advertised as they helped the government fund the war. These transformations provided both a booming wartime economy and an increase in opportunities for citizens nationwide. 

The United States entered the Second World War after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. About a month and a half after the attack, Congress passed the Emergency Price Control Act. This legislation allowed Congress to have control over the maximum prices of all products at all levels, including exports, imports, and purchases made by the country as a whole and the states.[^7] Along with controlling prices, the government could also limit how much money was in circulation, according to the National Park Service.[^8] People having less cash at their disposal means that prices could not go up because if they did, people would not have been able to afford anything. The National Park Service also states that the government was able to control the circulation of money through the Victory Bonds program and the expansion of income taxes. All of these things were done to limit inflation and allow citizens to afford everyday items. Another huge focus of the government was military production. The production of consumer goods went out the window, as the army and navy essentially became the United States’ largest investors and consumers.[^9] The government needed a great amount of materials to account for all of the military equipment and uniforms that factories were producing daily. Because of this, there was a high demand for materials such as metal, gasoline, fabric, and rubber, and it was announced that American citizens now needed to ration clothing, food, gasoline, and other supplies. A lot of items had to be packaged with different materials because of this. A good example is that many companies had to begin using glass jars instead of metal cans to preserve tin.[^10] The conservation of fabric can be seen in the production of women’s clothing, as skirts became shorter, hats became smaller, and clothing items overall became much more simple.[^11] Gasoline was one of the most critical items to ration because fuel was needed for planes, ships, and tanks. To preserve gasoline, the government took the action of lowering speed limits and promoting carpooling.[^12] All of these efforts combined were able to regulate the American economy during the war and save items for military usage.    

Besides price and inflation control and rationing, something else was going on in the American economy during the Second World War: a decreasing unemployment rate. The nation was in dire need of factory workers to help support the production of military supplies; therefore, millions of men and women joined the service and factory workforce, which caused unemployment to drop significantly. For example, unemployment went from 14.3 percent in 1937 to 9.9 percent in 1941, which is still not that low, but it marked the moment that unemployment averaged less than 10 percent for the first time in ten years.[^13] Furthermore, Gross National Product (GNP) during this time went from $99.7 billion in 1940 to almost $212 billion in 1945, meaning it more than doubled in only 5 years.[^14] Gross National Product is essentially the total monetary value of goods and services a country has produced in one year. This increase in jobs also provided new opportunities for both women and African Americans nationwide as more and more people were needed in the factories and the military. The purchasing and selling of war bonds was also a widespread effort during this time. War bonds were priced from twenty-five to one thousand dollars each and had a maturing age of ten years. Citizens would purchase the war bonds for lower than face value and would turn them in after the war to collect the remaining amount of money in order to make a profit. The purchasing of war bonds significantly helped the government fund wartime production.[^15] Without the hard work of factory employees and the constant amount of money being circulated, the economy would most likely not have succeeded as much as it did during this time. 

Overall, the Second World War was able to help the United States’ economy bounce back from the Great Depression by creating new jobs, increasing production and output, and regulating all things money. Inflation and prices were able to be kept at bay, Gross National Product skyrocketed, and nearly every American was employed and receiving a steady income. After the war, the G.I. Bill was introduced. This bill essentially gave war veterans an incredible amount of support by giving them educational benefits, low-cost housing, unemployment insurance, and business loans.[^16] This was extremely helpful as many war veterans had some trouble getting back into their everyday lives after years of fighting. The Second World War, although extremely violent and sorrowful, provided the United States with a booming economy, and it laid good groundwork for a successful post-war era for Americans.
