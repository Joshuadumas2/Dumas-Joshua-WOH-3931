World War II had an extreme impact on lives around the world, and while American soil may not have seen battle, the homefront certainly felt the effects of the conflict. One of the most well-known societal effects of the War on the USA was the shifting roles of women during the time. This essay section will serve to analyze the realities of women during World War II in both the working and domestic spheres, as well as interrogate the extent to which gender roles and stereotypes were challenged and enforced during this time.

Anticipation of American involvement in World War II resulted in the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, and when America joined the war in 1940 all eligible men from ages 18 to 45 were included in the draft.[^1] This resulted in a dearth of available, capable workers that needed to be filled to meet war production quotas. Without the normally available pool of male workers, the government turned to those still on the homefront which were, namely, women. You can see these recruitment efforts in many of the pieces of propaganda of the time, which appealed to a personal sense of national pride to encourage women to join the workforce, as well as raise morale for the women already in it. Women found new jobs in factories, hospitals, and other places of work, with 6 million women estimated to have joined the workforce during WWII.[^2] However, it is important to also consider what jobs were available to who. Many women at the time who were in lower-income households were already holding jobs to make ends meet, and women of color were more likely to get jobs with harsher working conditions and to be mistreated.[^3] While the influx of women into the workplace is undeniably a positive for women moving forward, the experience was not a universally welcoming one.

However, despite the movement past gender roles in the workforce, women were also expected to maintain traditional gender roles in the domestic sphere. While the government encouraged work in factories and other war-aiding areas, little to no help was offered when it came to familial responsibilities. Just as it was before the war, women were expected to manage their households by cooking, cleaning, and looking after their kids. Childcare during work hours fell to the working women to sort out, and gender performance in the domestic sphere was still expected to be done as perfectly as possible. Additionally, just as the government called for aid in the workforce, it also asked for aid in the domestic sphere. Rationing was common during the war, with necessary resources such as meat, sugar, and oil being severely limited. Women had to find ways to make ends meet with both time and available resources being severely limited by the war effort. Knitting bees and victory gardens[^4] were also common practices to aid in homefront war efforts, with local communities trying to foot the labor needed to get clothes to soldiers and diminish the amount of metal going into food cans. An excellent example of women’s continued expectations and responsibilities in the domestic sphere is the shift in the magazine Good Housekeeping.[^5] Good Housekeeping had been established since the 1850s and was a resource for housewives who were tasked with taking care of their households. The magazine upheld this status quo during the war, showing women how to deal with rationing and shortages and treating the war effort and the status quo shake-up more as a problem to solve rather than a true shift of societal values.
	
While this time is lauded as an advance for women past traditional gender roles and into equality in the workplace, the reality of the time is not as cut and dry. Women were still expected to maintain their appearances for men, despite their now occupying traditional male jobs, where this focus on looks was not the expectation for their male counterparts. Their looks were explicitly tied to war morale by society, and they were expected to be “girls worth fighting for”, being seen more as objects of morale rather than people who were doing their best to aid in the war effort. Harassment and work place wage discrimination were issues many women faced as well. Even recruitment had a gendered slant to it, with many recruitment posters downplaying the difficulty of the work women were doing and drawing comparisons to stereotypical gendered domestic tasks to try and appeal to the female demographic. After the war, women’s workplace efforts were dismissed as women were encouraged to leave the workforce and return to their “proper” places. There was an emphasis on the idea that women in the workforce was now silly and improper, and that men needed to take their place or the status quo would break entirely. This return to the status quo did not completely remove women from more male-dominated fields, but choosing to stay was going against explicit governmental and societal urgings. Despite all of this, women gained a foothold, however precarious, that was able to be used to lobby for equal pay and equal job opportunities in the future. This can still be seen today, with recruitment propaganda from the time being used in many women’s rights movements, with Rosie the Riveter being one of the most popular examples. While it may not be the complete step forward in the feminist movement it is often portrayed as, it is an important point in history that we still look back on today.[^6]

To summarize and conclude, women during World War II were expected to operate in both the working and domestic spheres, creating a tension between traditional gender roles with their corresponding expectations and the explicit breaking of those gender roles. While the time was not the idyllic liberation of women it is often represented as it does serve as an important moment in the history of women’s rights and is used to rally around even today.






## ANALYSIS 2: Homefront Economics - Katya Palma

During the Second World War, the economy of the United States went through significant changes. The government implemented many price controls and rationing policies, such as limiting the use of materials like gasoline, metal, and rubber. Production shifted almost entirely from consumer goods to military goods for obvious reasons, and unemployment was at a historical low as factory jobs multiplied to support wartime production. War bonds were also incredibly popular and heavily advertised as they helped the government fund the war. These transformations provided both a booming wartime economy and an increase in opportunities for citizens nationwide. 

The United States entered the Second World War after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. About a month and a half after the attack, Congress passed the Emergency Price Control Act. This legislation allowed Congress to have control over the maximum prices of all products at all levels, including exports, imports, and purchases made by the country as a whole and the states.[^7] Along with controlling prices, the government could also limit how much money was in circulation, according to the National Park Service.[^8] People having less cash at their disposal means that prices could not go up because if they did, people would not have been able to afford anything. The National Park Service also states that the government was able to control the circulation of money through the Victory Bonds program and the expansion of income taxes. All of these things were done to limit inflation and allow citizens to afford everyday items. Another huge focus of the government was military production. The production of consumer goods went out the window, as the army and navy essentially became the United States’ largest investors and consumers.[^9] The government needed a great amount of materials to account for all of the military equipment and uniforms that factories were producing daily. Because of this, there was a high demand for materials such as metal, gasoline, fabric, and rubber, and it was announced that American citizens now needed to ration clothing, food, gasoline, and other supplies. A lot of items had to be packaged with different materials because of this. A good example is that many companies had to begin using glass jars instead of metal cans to preserve tin.[^10] The conservation of fabric can be seen in the production of women’s clothing, as skirts became shorter, hats became smaller, and clothing items overall became much more simple.[^11] Gasoline was one of the most critical items to ration because fuel was needed for planes, ships, and tanks. To preserve gasoline, the government took the action of lowering speed limits and promoting carpooling.[^12] All of these efforts combined were able to regulate the American economy during the war and save items for military usage.    

Besides price and inflation control and rationing, something else was going on in the American economy during the Second World War: a decreasing unemployment rate. The nation was in dire need of factory workers to help support the production of military supplies; therefore, millions of men and women joined the service and factory workforce, which caused unemployment to drop significantly. For example, unemployment went from 14.3 percent in 1937 to 9.9 percent in 1941, which is still not that low, but it marked the moment that unemployment averaged less than 10 percent for the first time in ten years.[^13] Furthermore, Gross National Product (GNP) during this time went from $99.7 billion in 1940 to almost $212 billion in 1945, meaning it more than doubled in only 5 years.[^14] Gross National Product is essentially the total monetary value of goods and services a country has produced in one year. This increase in jobs also provided new opportunities for both women and African Americans nationwide as more and more people were needed in the factories and the military. The purchasing and selling of war bonds was also a widespread effort during this time. War bonds were priced from twenty-five to one thousand dollars each and had a maturing age of ten years. Citizens would purchase the war bonds for lower than face value and would turn them in after the war to collect the remaining amount of money in order to make a profit. The purchasing of war bonds significantly helped the government fund wartime production.[^15] Without the hard work of factory employees and the constant amount of money being circulated, the economy would most likely not have succeeded as much as it did during this time. 

Overall, the Second World War was able to help the United States’ economy bounce back from the Great Depression by creating new jobs, increasing production and output, and regulating all things money. Inflation and prices were able to be kept at bay, Gross National Product skyrocketed, and nearly every American was employed and receiving a steady income. After the war, the G.I. Bill was introduced. This bill essentially gave war veterans an incredible amount of support by giving them educational benefits, low-cost housing, unemployment insurance, and business loans.[^16] This was extremely helpful as many war veterans had some trouble getting back into their everyday lives after years of fighting. The Second World War, although extremely violent and sorrowful, provided the United States with a booming economy, and it laid good groundwork for a successful post-war era for Americans. 








## ANALYSIS 3: Homefront and Race relations / Civil Rights -  Noah Senzer

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'raceww'" %}
{% include media.html pages=media %}


Even before America officially joined the war, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took a bold step with Executive Order 8802 in June 1941, outlawing racial discrimination in the federal defense industry. Pushed by civil rights leaders like A. Philip Randolph, who threatened a march on Washington, this order aimed to open wartime jobs to African Americans, yet its limited enforcement nationwide meant that discriminatory hiring practices continued.[^17]

The war effort and its demand for labor caused a massive wave of migration, known as the Second Great Migration, with millions of African Americans leaving the rural South for industrial jobs in northern and western cities. This influx led to racial tensions, particularly in overcrowded industrial urban centers like Detroit, where the race riot of June 1943 left 34 people dead and hundreds more injured. Economic competition, housing shortages, and discriminatory practices fueled the violence,[^18] as white southern workers clashed with African American workers and residents of Detroit. It was not until 6,000 federal troops were deployed to the city that tensions finally began to de-escalate. The summer of 1943 saw two other major race riots, one in Beaumont, Texas between white and black wartime workers and another in New York City. Also in the Summer of 1943, racial tensions heightened in Los Angeles during the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943, when white sailors, alongside civilian mobs, attacked mostly Hispanic, but also African American, and even  Filipino-American youths who wore these suits.[^19] The zoot suits worn by these young men, with their oversized cut requiring far more fabric than typical clothing, became problematic, as fabric was heavily rationed during the war. While the suits symbolized youth rebellion and empowerment among minorities, as well as excess in a time of rationing, the deeper issue was rooted in the already established racial hostility directed at those minorities.

While African Americans were expected to support the war effort, they faced a harsh irony. The “Double V Campaign” was launched by the African-American newspaper, the Pittsburgh Courier in early 1942, and was a powerful symbol of African American activism during World War II. The "Double V" stood for victory abroad against fascism overseas and victory at home against racial inequality. Many African Americans, eager to contribute to the war effort, believed that their support would lead to improved racial conditions. One of the key aspects of the Double V campaign was the push for greater civil rights within the military. Despite President Roosevelt's Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial discrimination in defense industries, African Americans were still largely excluded from combat roles. Instead, they were assigned to support positions, such as mess attendants and supply troops, which, while essential, were often viewed as secondary roles. African American soldiers were also segregated into separate units, the most famous being the Tuskegee Airmen, an all-Black group of fighter pilots. Their distinguished service did help challenge racial stereotypes, but full integration of the military did not occur until 1948, three years after the war’s end. In the Jim Crow South, segregation remained strictly enforced by law, and acts of racial violence, including lynchings, continued without cessation. Between 1942 and 1945, 12 known lynchings occurred in the United States, all of the victims African American. 

Other minorities, such as Japanese Americans, also faced wartime prejudice. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese Americans on the West Coast were viewed with suspicion. Under Executive Order 9066, over 120,000 Japanese Americans were forcibly relocated to internment camps in desolate areas, losing their homes and businesses. The U.S. government justified this as a wartime necessity. While there were some instances of Japanese espionage or attempted sabotage in the U.S. and Hawaii, there was no evidence of widespread disloyalty among the larger Japanese American community. Despite this setback, many Japanese Americans still volunteered for military service. The 442nd Regimental Combat Team for example, made up mostly of Nisei or 2nd Generation Japanese-Americans, became one of the most decorated units in U.S. military history, serving with distinction in the European Theater of Operations.
	
These non-white servicemen, especially African Americans, returning home to the South also had to face the harsh reality of segregation and discrimination, despite their service and sacrifices during the war. They also found that the promises of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act were largely ignored, with its promised benefits being minimized or outright denied to them. These veterans struggled to access benefits such as housing loans and education, further disadvantaging minorities in an era that was supposed to offer post-war prosperity.

Race relations on the U.S. homefront during World War II however, were not solely defined by tension and inequality. The war also saw moments of racial unity and early steps toward desegregation. In industrial factories, the demands of wartime production brought both Black and white workers together in their efforts to support the war, shown in the famous "United We Win" poster, which depicts a black and white man working together in the factory. Though tensions continued, the shared struggle of the war and working-together in the wartime industries contributed to breaking down some barriers and promoting the idea of unity. The U.S. government and Hollywood also produced media to address racial bigotry and promote this unity. One notable example was the 1943-produced short film Don't Be a Sucker,[^20] which warned against the dangers of prejudice and fascist ideologies. It emphasized that racism weakened America and played into the hands of its enemies. These efforts, while largely limited in their impact, showed a growing awareness of the need to confront discrimination as incompatible with the democratic ideals the U.S. was fighting to defend abroad.


## ANALYSIS 4: Homefront and Culture - Samantha Kinggard

{% assign media = site.media_metadata | where_exp: "item", "item.name == 'pin'" %}

During the Second World War, we saw American culture change at a rapid pace. Information during this time was a sacred resource, and how people were sharing and receiving information was developing. During this time, people also began to spread messages through the use of propaganda, which became a significant part of American culture. America saw the growth of propaganda through films, the radio, and news broadcasting as the war was raging in Europe.
	
 One of the most influential parts of American culture while being on the American homefront during World War II was the spread of propoganda. According to “Women and War: St. Petersburg Women during World War II”, “Government propaganda, national periodicals, and local newspapers worked in unison to promote female employment, and popular songs like "Rosie the Riveter" inspired allegiance,”.[^21] Propaganda inspired many people on the American homefront, whether it was inspiring women to go to work or for people to support America’s involvement in the war. An important aspect about American propaganda was that it was always in places that were highly visible, accessible, and inexpensive, allowing for it to be seen by masses of people to spread the targeted message.[^22]

Propaganda that was used during this time include some of the most infamous pieces of art in American culture.  For example, Rosie the Riveter was a significant piece of American propaganda that shifted American culture. Rosie was “ a symbol for women in the workforce and for women’s independence.”[^23] The purpose of creating this image of Rosie the Riveter was to convince women to go to work to help with the jobs that were now vacated due to the influx of men going to war.[^24] We saw propaganda have a positive effect, as the amount of women in the workforce increased significantly, going “from 10.8 million in March, 1941, to more than 18 million in August, 1944.”[^25]
	
 The entity that was responsible for the spread of propagranda was the United States’s Office of War Information. This office was created by President Roosevelt with the intention of encouraging women and the people on the American homefront to contribute to the wartime efforts.[^26] This included people working in factories, businesses, and in any occupation that was left with openings when the workers went to war. This office was also meant to “undermine enemy morale” and to boost wartime production.[^27]
	
 Another significant part of American propaganda during the war was the use of films. The use of films in American propaganda was vital as, “At the outbreak of the Second World War, 80 million out of the 131 million Americans went to the cinema each week.”[^28] With so many people regularly attending the cinema, films were one of the best ways to spread propaganda to encourage people to go to work and to increase American allegiance. These films were created to not only spread information about the war efforts across the ocean, but it was also meant to increase morale. The movies produced during this time were full of patriotism and showed the value of “individual sacrifice for a larger cause.”[^29] These films would also introduce cartoons, portraying the enemy in a comedic way, or they would emphasize the importance of America’s involvement in the war and the need for America to win.[^30] The film industry played a significant role in spreading American propaganda. 
	
 The radio was also a significant part of the American cultural experience on the homefront. The radio played two main roles: to inform American citizens back home about current events in Europe and to use propaganda to encourage those back home to stay in business and to keep working to help the soldiers in Europe.[^31] As the war progressed, people became increasingly dependent on the radio for information, as there were not many other ways to get updates about the war. Not only would radio shows share news from the front lines, but they would also share war-related storylines, to help connect those on the homefront to those on the frontlines. For example, a series on the radio called “Soldiers of the Press” detailed the events that correspondents on the front lines had to go through.[^32] The use of radio was another significant part of the American homefront as it kept citizens informed.
	
 Another significant aspect of American propaganda was its use towards preparing for the end of the war. During the war, it was vital for women to step out of their homes and go to work force to help the American economy and the men fighting overseas. This need for women in the workforce was seen at the time as temporary. During the war effort, while women were working, they were “bombarded with propaganda extolling home life reminding them they would have to return to their homes when “‘the boys came back.”[^33] The use of propaganda kept women aware of how society viewed them and their roles while men were away at war and the expectations of them for when the war was over. Propaganda had two faces to it in terms of women in the workforce: to convince women to go to work and to convince women to stop working when the men came back.
	
 American propaganda was a significant aspect to American culture on the homefront. It was the best way to boost morale and keep the economy running. The use of propaganda was vital to keeping those at home connected and updated on the wartime efforts. A significant part of American culture during World War II was this use of propaganda through films and radio/news broadcasting.
