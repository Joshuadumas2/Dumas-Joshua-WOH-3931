American homes and cities did not face the same fate as European cities whose buildings and infrastructure were destroyed in air raids and on-the-ground fighting. However, the war drastically influenced American culture and society and permanently changed gender, race, and economic relations beyond the end of the war.

When young men left to fight in Europe and the Pacific, women filled in the gaps, and many neverleft. Not only did their participation in the labor force prevent the economy from collapsing, they supplied U.S. military campaigns across the world. These first female workers also paved the way for future generations by normalizing women in the workforce.

Undoubtedly, the American economy strengthened during the war. While raised taxes and rationing was challenging, the devastation of European industry secured the U.S. a position as a major exporter and the chief economic power at the war’s end. The GI Bill also rewarded veterans and artificially created a skilled labor force that would benefit the economy for decades.

World War II also took massive strides toward racial equality in the U.S. The limited workforce available during the war years forced desegregation in many workplaces across the country. Moreover, African-American participation both at home and in black military units emboldened the population to push for civil liberties. These efforts culminated in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and it is undeniable that World War II shaped the platform for civil rights leaders to call for racial justice in the U.S.

Newspapers directly connected Americans at home with the war effort, forcing the war to permeate into Americans’ homes. The constant focus on the war maintained high domestic enthusiasm for the war, further encouraged by propaganda spread by the U.S. government. Returning veterans were met with celebrations of what was considered a noble effort to restore the world order. This “net-good” perception of U.S. involvement in the war endured beyond 1945 and persists today.

The Second World War propelled the United States to a never-before-seen level of global power and influence. Its military conquests established worldwide American influence that culminated in the global hegemony it reached in the 1990s. Still, U.S. victory in the war could not have been accomplished without the efforts of the men and women who remained on the American homefront.
