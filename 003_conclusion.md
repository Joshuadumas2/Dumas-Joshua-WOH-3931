# Conclusion
## Katia Huddleston

After Pearl Harbor, American homes and cities did not face the same fate as Dresden, London, and other European cities whose buildings and infrastructure were destroyed in air raids and on-the-ground fighting. However, as we’ve observed, the war drastically influenced American culture and society between 1941 and 1945 and permanently changed gender, race, and economic relations beyond the end of the war.
Women entered the U.S. workforce in waves in 1941, and many never left. When young American men left to fight in Europe and the Pacific, women stepped in to fill the gaps. Not only did their participation in the labor force prevent the economy from collapsing at home, they built trucks, planes, and weaponry that supported U.S. military campaigns across the world. These first female workers paved the way for future generations by normalizing women in the workforce.
Undoubtedly, the American economy strengthened and consolidated during the war. While raised taxes and rationing challenged Americans at home, factory production boomed, and the devastation of European industry secured the United States a position as a major exporter and the chief economic power at the war’s end. The U.S. government took advantage of this unique economic opportunity and created the GI Bill. Not only did this reward World War II veterans, it artificially created a skilled labor force that would continue to benefit the American economy for decades.

Beyond the economy, World War II took massive strides toward racial equality in the United States. The limited workforce available during the war years forced desegregation in many workplaces across the country. Moreover, African-American participation both at home and in black military units emboldened the population to push for civil liberties, especially after efforts to reinstall racial discrimination after the war. These efforts culminated in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and it is undeniable that World War II shaped the platform for civil rights leaders to call for racial justice in the United States.

Newspapers and broadcasting directly connected Americans at home with the war effort, forcing the war to permeate into Americans’ homes, businesses, and communities constantly. The constant focus on the war maintained high domestic enthusiasm for the war, and this was no doubt encouraged by propaganda spread by the U.S. government. Following the war’s conclusion, veterans were met with parades and celebrations of what was considered a noble effort to restore the world order. This “net-good” perception of U.S. involvement in World War II endured beyond 1945 and still persists today through memorials and annual celebrations of Americans’ sacrifices.

The Second World War propelled the United States to a level of global power and influence that the country had never experienced. Its military conquests established a strong American presence from Europe to Asia that culminated in the global hegemony it reached in the 1990s. Still, U.S. victory in the war could not have been accomplished without the efforts of the men and women who remained on the American Homefront.
